                                goal kickers including Andrew Mehrtens, Simon Culhane, John Earls, Dan Carter, Gavin Henson &

                                Previously known as the Simpkin Tee, it was designed by the late 
                                rugby legend George Simpkin and was one of the first kicking tees made. Simon Culhane still holds 
                                the record for the most successful kicks in a Rugby World Cup match with 20 kicks (using this tee).
                                Jimmy Gopperth, the 3x English Premiership Golden Boot Winner has scored over 3600 points off the tee.
